        // This user is going to have an id within the users mapping. so no changes to the id.

        // The problem we have here is that we tried to store the id of the mapping users
        // within a user memory variable. And then, we went and modified that user memory variable 
        // and changed its balance, as explained below. Consequently, user became a local variable stored in memory. 
        
        //If you want to store the id of the mapping users within a variable, the easiest solution is 
        // to change memory to storage. This will allow the local variable user 
        // to be a direct pointer to the User that is in the mapping value.
        
        // Another way to solve the problem is to have users[id].balance = balance. 
        // In here, You are not creating new information that makes reference to other saved information.
        // In here, you are not storing the id of the mapping users in a variable that needs reference.
        // same like in previous smart contracts, when we did people[creator] = newPerson;
        // That is the same thing as the first solution, but accomplished in one line.
        // This is because the mapping users is added to storage automatically, so there is no need to mention 
        // any storage. You will be able in this case to direct and change the balance in the mapping itself.
